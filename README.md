This project emulates a Philips Hue Bridge that is able to control ZigBee lights (using Raspbee module, original Hue Bridge or IKEA Trådfri Gateway), Mi-Light bulbs (using MiLight Hub), Neopixel strips (WS2812B and SK6812) and any cheap ESP8266 based bulb by replacing the firmware with a custom one. It is written in Python and will run on all small devices such as the Raspberry Pi. Arduino sketches are provided for the Hue Dimmer Switch, Hue Tap Switch and Hue Motion Sensor. Lights are two-way synchronized so any change made from original Philips/Trådfri sensors and switches will also be applied to the bridge emulator.

## Getting Started

All documentation and instructions can be found over at [diyhue.readthedocs.io](https://diyhue.readthedocs.io/)

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Python modules: ws4py, requests, astral, paho-mqtt [see requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)

 or

- Docker ;-)

## Recommendation

- Hue Essentials phone app for remote control and entertainment effects.
- WS2812 Strip + Wemos D1 mini board for cool entertainment affects.
- RaspberryPi 3B connected via ethernet port to your network for bridge emulation (avoid using 2 interfaces in the same time).

## Working HUE features

- Control lights (all functions)
- Control groups (all functions)
- Scenes (all functions)
- Routines
- Wake up
- Go to sleep
- Switches (custom esp8266 switches)
- Autodiscover lights
- Hue entertainment
  
## Working devices and applications

- Amazon Alexa (control only the lights)
- Logitech Harmony
- Trådfri Gateway
- Hue Bridge (original + other emulators)
- Home Assistant
- Domoticz
- Openhab
- Philips Ambilight TV's
- Kodi Hue Ambilight
- Jeedom
- Hue Sync for PC
- Deconz
- Zigbee2mqtt [see mqtt](https://diyhue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lights/mqtt.html)

## Working smartphone applications

- Hue (official application)
- [Hue Essentials](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.superthomaslab.hueessentials) - recommended
- hueManic
- OnSwitch
- HueSwitcher
- LampShade

## Not working

- Home & Away future from Hue app (requires remote api)
- Google Home (requires remote api)
- Eneco Toon (very likely it uses cloud service detection)
  
## Supported lights

- WS2812B and SK6812 smart led strips
- MiLight
- Yeelight
- LYT8266
- Phillips Hue
- Ikea Trådfri
- Pwm RGB-CCT
- Pwm RGBW
- Pwm RGB
- Pwm CCT
- Pwm Dimming (up to 6 lights for every esp8266)
- On/Off plugs/lights (up to 6 lights for every esp8266)
- On/Off 433Mhz devices (multiple devices for every esp8266)
- MQTT lights [see mqtt](https://diyhue.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lights/mqtt.html)
- [Hyperion.ng](https://github.com/hyperion-project/hyperion.ng)
  
## To Do

- esp8266 alarm horn (+schematic)
- Alarm (~~email notification~~ + eps8266 horn)

## Support

If you need help with diyHue you can get support from other users, aswell as the maintainer.

[![Discourse](https://img.shields.io/discourse/users?server=https%3A%2F%2Fdiyhue.discourse.group)](https://diyhue.discourse.group) Our Board might already have your fix and answer ready. Have a look!

Since Slack is faster at providing live Support but not as good when it comes to save and show known Issues, we kindly ask you to open a Topic at our Discourse group. This will provide Help for others in the future.

Note:
Please provide some Logs to make it easier for all of us. Enable Debug by manually starting diyHue with additional `--debug true` argument.

diyHue is Opensource and maintained by volunteers in their free time. You are welcome to contribute and become a recognised member of the diyHue community.

## Stability

All the lights in my house are controlled by this solution so the stability is very important to me as there is no turning back to classic illumination (all switches were replaced with Ikea Trådfri Remotes and holes covered). However, I don't use all the functions, so I'm unable to perform full tests on every change. What I do currently use is Deconz with all Trådfri devices (lights + sensors), Xiaomi Motion Sensor, native ESP8266 bulbs, ESP8266 + WS2812B strips, and Xiaomi YeeLight color bulbs.
  
Please post on our [Slack team](https://slackinvite.squishedmooo.com/) any other device/application that you find to work with this emulator.

## qtHue

You also may want to see my new project [qtHue](https://github.com/mariusmotea/qtHue) that provides a simple user interface for controlling the lights.
